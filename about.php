  			<p>    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_education" target="_blank">Open Education</a> is a platform which provides best possible web material, online video lectures & eLearning material sources. It's been set up with the sole intention to help any student provide with the best possible sources. Anyone who has willingness to learn is a student. 
            
            <br/><br/> Preperation for global competitiveness by fostering Educational Excellence & ensuring equal access is what Open Education thrives. It's been proven through various studies that online learning methods are, on average, at least as effective as face-to-face learning. With the implementation of right kind of Technology, we can overcome some of the limitations that we have in our "Classroom Model". With Online Education we can achieve self-paced, personalized learning over 'one-size-fits-all' mantra that we follow in our "Classroom Model". Your Computer doesn't get tired showing you the same video ten times. Even in a row. You can pause the video, go back & forth at your own convience. We can answer some basic questions like student attention span with the help of technology & Online learning. 
            
             <br/><br/>Open Education has been highly inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Khan_%28educator%29">Sal Khan</a>'s <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>. And also Daphne Koller's <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>. Open Education shares the same motive : Setting up a global classroom where anyone can learn at their own pace with Online Education.
